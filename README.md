FPS Multi-Counter ([Asset Store](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#!/content/85526))
===
The FPS Multi-Counter will measure the current frames per second of your application. It's called multi counter because besides measuring the average fps, it will also measure the highest and lowest framerates on a defined interval.

To use this plugin, simply drag the FPS Counter from the Prefabs folder and drop as a child of the scene Canvas.

As this repository is public, you are free to contribute and share your ideas and suggestions. My goal is to make the plugin always better and more user friendly.

Enjoy and leave a rating on the Asset Store!
